How to setup the database stuff in visual studio
1. Open the server explorer in VS
2. Click on the Connect to Database button
3. Add your server name. Mine is "(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDb" if
	you connect to your SQL Server in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio,
	it's that server name.
4. Look down near the bottom of the form. You can either select an
	existing database or type the name of a new database. I called mine
	"CIS560Project". Once you create it you can select it in the future.
5. Now you should be able to run SQL scripts in Visual Studio. After changes
	are made to the database you can right click on the database connection in the
	Server Explorer and click refresh to show changes.
